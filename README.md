# Haskell project
In this project, the data structures necessary for analyzing a two-player board game were developed. Type classes Functor, Applicative, and Monad were instantiated, and operations were implemented to change the game state using the concept of the State monad. A parser was also implemented that reads the state of the board and a list of moves to be applied to the loaded board from a file
